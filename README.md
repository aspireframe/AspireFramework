AspireFramework
===============

Aspire Framework has evolved as automation tool for enterprise wide university accreditation and compliance. We aspire to define a unified, and universally accepted international framework for automating the university compliances in reference to ABET Accreditation, European Bologna Standards and Other International Best Practices adopted for development of University Curriculum. This framework aspires to establish a common core framework for educational standards in a uniform manner. The Aspire Framework is governed by GPL v3.0 Licensing Guidelines. The Aspire Project is architected, designed and developed by Territorial Prescience Research I P Ltd and the first testbed has been at Taif University, KSA.  Some of the Key Contributors are Dr. Awase Khirni Syed, Dr. Mehdi Mehsud, Dr. Irfan Ahmed, Dr. Arif Bhatti, Mr. Shabbir Hassan, Mr. Asad Aman, Mr. Altaf Hussain Pandit and Mr. Ashfaq. This Project is being developed using Python Django Framework with MySQL 5 backend. We intend to extend the support to other open source databases such as PostgresSQL.
